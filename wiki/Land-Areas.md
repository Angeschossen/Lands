### What is a Area?
Land areas are "sub areas/lands" inside a land. These areas are three dimensional, that means that they are not bound to chunks but instead to blocks. You can trust players to specific area(s) and apply flags for it, like you would do for a land.

### Create a new Area
1. First open your land menu with /Lands menu and click on the areas item. Depending on your servers configuration of the GUI menus the item position may vary.
