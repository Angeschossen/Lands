########################################
# BASIC MODE
########################################
# If enabled, Lands will disable advanced features, like wars, nations, upkeep and taxes.
# Enabling this option will disable all advanced features. Meaning that only the bare
# minimum of features will be enabled. This option is meant for servers that want to
# have a very simple setup and only want players to use the claiming and trusting players
# feature of the plugin. Enabling this option will forcefully disable some features, that
# can't be turned back on as long as basic-mode is enabled.
# NOTE: This setting requires server reload / restart.

# MAJOR FEATURES
########################################
# Here you can quickly toggle some major features.
# NOTE: These settings require server reload / restart.
features:
  # Ukeep can be further configured in the upkeep section (this file).
  upkeep: true
  # Taxes can be further configured in the taxes section (this file).
  # For taxes to work, Vault and a economy plugin, that supports Vault, needs to be installed.
  taxes: true
  # Lands and nations can be in relations, such as ally, enemy and neutral.
  # If you disable this option, all existing relations will be deleted.
  # This is useful in combination with wars. However, you can also use it with wars disabled.
  relations: true


# General options
general:
  # Worlds where players should be able to claim. You can add all worlds by adding * to the list.
  # This list also supports setting an optional player claims height per world.
  # Example: world:30:319 -> this will configure the world 'world' with a claim height from 30 to 319.
  # NOTE: Minimum height can't be lower than your server's min height and maximum height can't be higher than your servers maximum height.
  # NOTE: The claim height of admin lands will always be maxed out.
  # NOTE: This setting requires server reload / restart.
  claim-worlds_list:

  # Default: English (en-US) - no download required.
  # This defines the default language. You can place multiple locales in the plugin's "Language" folder to display different locales depending on the player's locale.
  # You can access translations maintained by the community in our Discord: https://discord.incredibleplugins.com
  # To access translations, other than en-US, execute /translations in the Discord server.
  # The translation name should match the official language code (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html).
  # This option also affects the grouping and decimal separator for currency formatting.
  language: 'en-US'
  # Force default language? This will make changes to language files impossible and will always use the default.
  # This has the benefit of always receiving fixes, such as spelling mistakes, for the default locale.
  # You should only use this option if your language matches "en-US". For other locales it won't work.
