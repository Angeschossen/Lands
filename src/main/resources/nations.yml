# Let lands, which are part of a nation pay taxes.
# If a land is member of a nation they won't pay upkeep to the server anymore. Instead
# they will pay taxes to the nation. To prevent abuse of this, it's recommended enabling nations upkeep,
# so the nation needs to pay upkeep to the server depending on their size.
# NOTE: This option is bound to the upkeep option from config.yml. Upkeep needs to be enabled in config.yml.
