# ###############################
# About chat message type system:
# Does only work for messages in
# "message" or "command" section.
# ###############################

# You can use some codes to set the type
# of a message to title, actionbar or chat.
# How does it work:

# For example we want to print the prefix as a title:
# Set general.noPerm to: '#t#&cYou''re not allowed to do this.' (Set "#t#" in front of it)
# This would just print it as a title.

# You also can set in, stay and out fade timings in seconds:
# Set for example general.prefix to: '#t#!!1!!2!!3!!&cYou''re not allowed to do this.'
# This would display this message as a title with
# a fade in delay of 1 seconds, a stay time with 2 seconds
# and a fade out delay of 3 seconds.

# You also can display it as a actionbar message:
# Just add "#a#" in front of it.
# If you want to display it in chat, just don't set any
# of these in front of it or use "#c#".

# Also you can combine these modes:
# Set for example general.prefix to: '#c#a#t#!!1!!2!!3!!&cYou''re not allowed to do this.'
# This would print this message as chat, actionbar and an title with an in delay (1 seconds),
# stay time (2 seconds) and fade out delay (3 seconds)
# For any questions or issues, please contact me on discord or via pm.
