# This file is only relevant if Redis is enabled in config.yml.
# Here you can override the server-name and master option for Redis.
# Since copying the config.yml from one server to another will cause issues, if you don't adjust
# the Redis server-name and master option, you can configure these values in this file, so they override the config.yml Redis options.
# Just remove the comments at the option lines and set your desired value.

# This should be the name that you configured for this server in your BungeeCord or Velocity config.
# NOTE: If you're using mutlipaper, this option will be overridden by multipaper's own name decision.
#server-name: "server-1"

# This option should only be enabled on ONE of the servers that are connected to the same Lands database and Redis.
# If true: This server will execute tasks, such as upkeep, taxes etc. for all lands across all servers that are connected to the same Lands database and Redis.
# NOTE: If you're using multipaper, make sure to provide the actual name of the multipaper instance that should be the master server (not the multipaper master).
#master: false
