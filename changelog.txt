+ Changed how the following commands work:
- /lands trust
- /lands untrust
- /lands setrole
- /lands ban
- /lands unban

When no <area> argument is provided the command is executed for the whole land instead of just the default area.

+ Changed: /lands leave now removes the player from the whole land, if the "here" argument isn't provided

+ Added: You can now configure two different chunk distance options for buffer zones between lands.
If you had an existing configuration, you need to re-configure it.

  # Set the minimum distance in chunks (16 blocks).
  # Players can bypass this restriction, if their role has the LAND_CLAIM_BORDER flag in the neighboring land.
  chunk-distance:
    # Set the minimum distance in chunks (16 blocks) between two lands that aren't part of any nation.
    land_2: 1
    # Set the minimum distance between a land and a nation or two nations.
    nation: 3

- Fixed: Tenant UUID if sold
