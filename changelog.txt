+ Added: You can now configure two different chunk distance options for buffer zones between lands.
If you had an existing configuration, you need to re-configure it.

  # Set the minimum distance in chunks (16 blocks).
  # Players can bypass this restriction, if their role has the LAND_CLAIM_BORDER flag in the neighboring land.
  chunk-distance:
    # Set the minimum distance in chunks (16 blocks) between different lands.
    land_2: 2
    # Set the minimum distance between a land and a nation or two nations.
    nation: 1

- Fixed: Tenant UUID if sold
