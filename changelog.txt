+ Added: Support for new skin playerprofiles
The old custom head textures are no longer supported by the server.
Therefore you need to change any custom heads in your GUI and roles.yml files to the new
skin URLs. Here you can find more information on how to do that: https://github.com/Angeschossen/PluginFrameworkAPI/wiki/New-Head-Textures
The default GUI custom heads can be found here:
 * GUI: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/blob/master/definitions_gui.yml
 * roles: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/blob/master/roles.yml
