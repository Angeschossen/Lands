+ Added: general.permission-stacking option
  # If enabled, limit permissions will be combined instead of just taking the highest value.
  # Example: A player has the permission lands.chunks.5 and lands.chunks.2.
  #          If enabled: This will result in a limit of 7 chunks.
  #          If disabled: This will result in a limit of 5 chunks.
