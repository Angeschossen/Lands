- Fixed: Issue where saved icons would cause a request to be made for the session servers to mojang at the server startup since the servers inbuild serialization would not take the profile url into account.
If you're having this issue and getting rate limit messages after startup, try the following:

1. Stop server
2. Download and install **at least version 7.11.1 of Lands**
3. Start server
4. Stop server
5. Enable force-save in config.yml under logging (at the bottom of the config)
6. Start server
7. Stop server. Shutdown will take longer this time.
8. Disable force-save in config.yml under logging (at the bottom of the config)
