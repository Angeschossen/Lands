+ Added: You can now specify flags to be toggleable for the tenant role (roles.yml)
      # Allow lands to toggle specific flags for this role? They can only do this while the area is NOT rented.
      # WARNING: Keep in mind that this could allow lands to rent out areas, in which tenants can't do much or nothing depending
      # on the "allow-edit" list. You can add "all" to the list to allow them to toggle all flags for this role.
      # NOTE: They still need the generl toggle permission for the flags. These can be found in the wiki: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/wiki/Permissions#toggle-role-flags
      allow-toggle-flags: []

- Fixed: [#2240] assinging areas for a admin land
