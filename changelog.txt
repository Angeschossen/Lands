Attention: The old SQLite and MySQL database schemas are no longer supported, please migrate to the new ones, if you don't
use SQLite-v2 or MySQL-v2 in the configuration. The plugin will send you a warning at startup, if this is the case.
Instructions: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/wiki/Database#schema-migration

While the old schema still works, its recommended to migrate to the new one for better performance and future features.
