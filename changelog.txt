+ Added: [Suggestion] You can now define min and max distance for each world at rtp
  # Worlds where players should be able to use /lands wild.
  # You can use '*' as a entry, to allow all worlds.
  # Entry format: worldName:minDistance:maxDistance
  # The minimum and maximum distance is measured from the world spawn (/setworldspawn).
  wild-worlds_list:
    - "world:800:30000"
