+ Added: [Suggestion] short-unit format
    # The short format will use the normal format if the value is lower than 1000.
    # This format is only used in cases where there is not much space, like on signs.
    # This will convert balances like the following:
    # 1000000000 = 1B whereas {value} = 1 and {unit} = B
    # 1000000 = 1M
    # 1000 = 1k
    short-unit: '${value}{unit}'

- Fixed: 3rd party plugins not able to set default state for flag
